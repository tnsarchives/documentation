## Background

*This workflow was established for transfer of video recordings for a Comics Symposium Series sponsored every semester by Parsons Illustration Dept.*

This might be used as a jumping-off point for a general set of guidelines describing collecting AV event material from other departments.
This file should be compared against any instructions already written for the Vera List Center. However, in the past I’m not sure that VLC has provided releases. The VLC practice may need to be altered so that we are sure to obtain releases at the time that we are given the videos. (This may be tricky because the videos are generally dropped off by the videographer, who would not have the releases--but I think we should try and figure out a way to do this.)

The permission form (release) that we’re using is almost identical to the oral history interview form--it allows for speakers to select two options for making the recording available (online or in-archives-only). [add file path]

## Accession Overview

When we acquire recordings of departmental events, we need to obtain three types of files: 

The audio or AV file itself;
A file containing a completed release (permission) form bearing the signatures of each speaker. (We provide the department with a blank release, found in the Agreements/oral history public programs folder called: Oral History_Symposium Agreement_20160112_CURRENT. The department is then wholly responsible for obtaining signatures on the releases from speakers.¨If they don't provide us with a release to match the video, we do not take the video. This remains the responsibility of the department.) 
Clearly-related information, or link to information, about the series, with titles, dates, names of speakers/panelists.
 
The following is an example of instructions provided to the Parsons Illustration department sponsoring the Comics Symposium event series:
 
Twice a year, after the last of each semester's symposia:
 
1. Create a folder on the external hard drive that clearly indicates it contains the recordings for the archives. Something like this: FOR THE ARCHIVES_COMICS SYMPOSIA FALL 2017. 
 
2. Name all video files exactly according to the naming convention provided below. Make sure they are free of symbols (&@$!? etc.), no commas, no periods (except right before file extension).
 
3. Name all permission form (a.k.a. release) files exactly the same way that you name the video files. (See below.)
 
4. Put releases into the same folder as the video files on the external drive. There should be releases covering every video that is transferred to the archives. If there is no release for a session, or if one is missing for a session that has more than one speaker, do not include that video in the folder. We cannot take any video without accompanying releases. 
 
5. Contact us at archivist@newschool.edu to arrange drop-off of the external drive.
 
*VERY IMPORTANT -- FILE NAMING:* 
 
The file naming convention for events should be as follows:
[DATE in this format: yyyymmdd][underscore][speaker's first name][underscore][speaker's last name].
 
The permission forms (releases) should be formatted exactly the same way as the event recording, so that the only difference will be the file extension (except for a session where there were two or more speakers--then file names won't quite match exactly).
