## Guidelines

This is information for those outside of the archives from whom we’ve agreed to accept oral history interviews. They must follow all guidelines.

The New School Archives is pleased that you have agreed to deposit your oral history interview with the archives, where it will be preserved and made available for research to the New School community and the general public.

In order for your submission to be complete, you must provide all of the following items. Failure to submit any one of these items will result in an incomplete submission. Your oral history will not be saved in the Archives until all of these items have been received and approved as complete by the Archives:

1.   The New School Archives Oral History Agreement (if you need one, email us at archivist@newschool.edu), signed and completely filled out by your subject (interviewee) and by you (interviewer). (You must provide both a scanned version of the completed agreement, as well as the actual original signed [not a copy].)
2.   All master digital audio (BWAV or WAV files) and/or video file(s) of completed interview or interviews; the filename(s) must include your instructor's last name (if the interview is conducted for a class), your last name, your subject's last name, date of interview, and a number, beginning with "01" (zero-one) for each new interview, in the following manner:
[Instructor name]_[Your name]_[Subject name]_[Date]_[File number]

For example:
Napolin_Smith_Zapruder_20140516_01
Napolin_Smith_Zapruder_20140516_02
Napolin_Smith_Oswald_20140314_01
Napolin_Smith_Oswald_20140314_02

3.   A Word or PDF file (name the file with your instructor's name, and your last name) with the following items in it:
(a) short statement of purpose and your goals for the project;
(b) brief autobiographical statement about yourself, written in the third person; include information about your background, about when you came to the New School, what you are studying, and your year of birth;
(c) biographical summary of your interview subject (interviewee); you can use your interviewee's CV and any background research you've done and/or information you've gleaned about the person from the interview--this should written in complete sentences, not a bulleted list of accomplishments or timeline; include year and place of birth;
(d) summary of the interview you conducted (include location where interview was conducted).

**Project Overview and Aim**

*Example by Carmen Hendershott*

The New School Oral History Interview Project, undertaken by New School librarian Carmen Hendershott for the New School Archives beginning in the summer of 2012, aims to supplement the often-incomplete written institutional records of the New School by recording the oral reminiscences of members of the New School community, especially longtime faculty, staff, and administrators. In this way, accounts of histories of positions, departments, divisions, institutes and centers, and memorable persons of the New School will be documented, preserved and made available to the public.

*Example from the Brooklyn Historical Society*

Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. 2007 marked the 40th anniversary of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the oldest community development corporation (CDC) in the United States, founded in 1967 through the efforts of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob Javits.  Founding Board members, supporters, activists, artists, tenants, and other community members, over 50 narrators total, were interviewed to document Restoration’s pioneering work. 

*Example from The New School Archives*

This project consists of nine interviews undertaken in preparation for the exhibition, Radical Shifts: Reshaping the Interior at Parsons, 1955-1985. The exhibition ran from March 23 to April 8, 2011 in the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center, Parsons The New School for Design, 66 Fifth Avenue in New York City. The interviews were conducted by Joanna Merwood-Salisbury, professor of architectural history and an administrator in Parsons The New School for Design's School of Constructed Environments; and by Wendy Scheir, director of the Kellen Design Archives at Parsons.
