Collect Files
1. Coordinate with department contacts to transfer thesis files -- it is preferable that they bring the files on an external hard drive to archives office, but they can also be accepted via Google Drive.

## Create records for unrestricted material
1. After all responses are submitted, download spreadsheet of responses created from the Google Form and save to corresponding Collections folder in K: Central Kellen share. 
2. Create two duplicate spreadsheets of the submissions, saving both to K: Digital_accessions_to_be_processed. 
One will contain submissions with restricted access until the following year.
The second will contain submissions ready to be published. 
3. Save files in same folder as related spreadsheet
4. Format files: 
Add collection identifier (PC020402 for Design + Technology; PC020403 for Photography) followed by an underscore to filenames using Bulk Rename Utility.
Create a series record in CollectiveAccess for the year and batch edit the thesis object records to attach to the series.
