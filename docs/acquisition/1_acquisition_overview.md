## Born Digital Files 

*Before Acquisition and Accession*

**When Working with Department/Staff to Transfer Born-Digital Files.** Digital archivist consults with authorized representative from department. Transfer plan is developed.

Some reorganization of files and directories may be necessary (to be completed by the department) so that restricted files (and other files that have been identified as non-archival) may be segregated from material to be transferred.

For born-digital files, prior to acquisition, ask department representative to create inventory to be provided with files.

**All Digital Material.** Create accession record in AT for born-digital accessions; if files come to the Archives along with physical accession, indicate existence and location of digital files in the same accession file as physical collection.
