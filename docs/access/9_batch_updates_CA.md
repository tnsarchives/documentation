## 1. Create a Set
Select the records you would like to include by performing a search. In this example, we search on the base identifier. 
 - In the upper right corner, select ‘Find’ > ‘Objects’
 - Search: [NS021201] > Click ‘Search’ 
 - After results are returned, select ‘Set Tools’ from the left menu
 - Select ‘Create Set’ and use the dialog box to name your set. You’ll see a dropdown menu that allows you to add records from the search results, or from checked records. Clicking the box ‘Open set for batch editing’ will automatically open batch editing for this set. If that option is selected, the next step can be skipped. 

## 2. Batch Edit a Set
 - In the upper right menu, select ‘Manage’ and then ‘My sets.’ Locate your new set and select the files icon in the ‘# Items’ column to batch edit the records.
