title: Create Batch Metadata 
---

There are two templates to use for importing data when batch creating new records. Batch Imports only occur when more than 10 digital files need to be uploaded to Collective Access.
 - Standard Template: Batch_Upload_Template.xls
 - Thesis Template: Batch_Upload_Thesis_Mapping_Template.xls
Location: Central_Kellen_Share/DigitalArchives/Digital_CollectiveAccess/Import/Batch_Upload_Template.xls

## Creating Metadata
Step 1: Prepare a metadata spreadsheet for Scan Tech to use while digitizing material
Supervisory archivist will complete the following fields for Scan Tech before they begin digitizing material: 

Collection [Format:  Use collection or series identifier.] 
Example: 
Institute for Retired Professionals collection would be: NS022101
Report of the Commission on Older Students at the New School for Social Research series would be:  NS022101_000006

Step 2: Scan Tech completes fields while scanning
In the interest of quality control, descriptive metadata should be created by a worker other than the Scan Tech. The only fields to be completed by the Scan Tech while digitizing, will be: 
Media Filename
The filename is derived from the resource identifier created in Archivists’ Toolkit (Resources > Series > Resource Identifier). 
Sample Resource Identifier: NS.03.01.05
Sample Filename: NS030105_000173 (000173 scan number)
Multi-page documents will have pages added with an underscore 
Sample Filename: NS030105_000173_pg01
Sample Filename: NS030105_000173_pg02

box #, folder # (if applicable)

Step 

While completing the batch upload spreadsheet described below, worker should simultaneously check accuracy and quality of file. QA Checklist: 
Review that all pages are present 
Confirm whether any images are missing data
Check that pages do not need to be rotated, etc.
Template
When there are enough files being digitized to warrant a batch upload, Archivist sets up a spreadsheet.

Format:  Use collection or series identifier. For example:
