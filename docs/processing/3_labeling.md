## Overview

**LABEL ALL CONTAINERS!**

Even when mid-project and you know what is in an unmarked box, never, ever, EVER leave a box or folder or other kind of container that has something in it unlabeled. ALWAYS put a post-it or other kind of temporary label clearly identifying the contents on the FRONT of the box. Even if you plan to discard the contents later on, if there is something inside that container, label the container.

When you put an item, container or anything else, on a shelf, make sure that its label is right side up, facing OUTWARD, and is clearly visible to the naked eye. You should be able to read the label easily without having to turn the item to locate the label.

**CROSS OUT LABELS ON EMPTY CONTAINERS!**

Whenever you have emptied a folder, box, or any container that is to be saved for reuse (or even to be thrown away):
1. In pencil, CROSS OUT any and all information (and stamps) written on now-empty containers—there should be NO empty containers (meaning boxes, folders, binders, ANYthing with labels or notes on the outside that once contained something inside) with collection titles or any other markings on them that are not crossed out.
2. PUT AWAY empty containers. Put them in their appropriate spot (ask Wendy or Jenny, if you're not positive where they belong). DO NOT leave empty folders and boxes lying around unless you plan to use them again SOON.

## Box Numbering

We use many different size boxes in the New School Archives. Because we use the box sizes as a way of identifying the locations of archival materials, it is important to be accurate in box numbering (see section on [box sizes](processing/2_rehousing.md) for more information.)

All boxes are numbered, even if the collection only consists of one box. In this case, it would simply be “Box 1.”

Rules for box numbering:
1. For regular RCs, ABs, and smallest flat boxes [~13 x 16] the numbering begins with “Box 1” and continues for each subsequent regular RC, AB, and small flat box. Each collection or record group starts at box 1 for that collection
2. OS boxes:
OSx = start at OSx-1 and increase sequentially
        	OSxx = start at OSxx-1 and increase sequentially
        	OSxxx = start at OSxxx-1 and increase sequentially
3. Mixed boxes:
Collections or portions of collections with items that take up less than a full box should go into Mixed KA, Mixed PC, or Mixed NS boxes, depending on whether they are KA, PC, or NS collections . Mixed boxes start with box 1, OSx-1, OSxx-1, or OSxxx-1, depending on size.

Collections in mixed boxes intellectually remain a part of the collection they are a part of, even though they are physically stored with material from other collections.
Mixed boxes are numbered in the following format: [first letter of repository (e.g. New School, Kellen, Parsons)]_[box size if oversized, otherwise skip]_[sequential number]
Examples:
  - p_OSxx-2
  - k_1
  - n_OSx-1

All boxes sent offsite are barcoded and the barcodes are entered into AT (instructions for entering locations in AT can be found here.) These boxes are also entered into a Filemaker database to track delivery requests and returns, see Workflow: Filemaker Offsite Database.

## Folder Numbering  
Each folder within a box or file drawer receives a title and a number. The number indicates the box number and the location of the folder within the box or drawer relative to all the other folders in that box or drawer. No folder should ever be left without a numerical designation.

Each folder number is comprised of three components: the number of the box, a decimal point, and numerical location of the folder in the box.
Example:	The third folder in a Box 2 would be expressed as: 2.3
 
The folder numbering begins at 1 at the beginning of each new box, and increases sequentially by one unit until arriving at the very last folder in the rear of the box or the bottom of the drawer (the folder at the very top of the drawer is designated 1). Do not skip numbers unless otherwise instructed.

Folder numbers are written in pencil on the far right top corner of a legal or document size folder. For large flat folders, it is written on the far right side of the closed end of the folder. Do not write out the word “folder”; just the number.

Please make sure to write neatly and to press down hard enough that the numbering is easily legible. This is important because researchers use the folder number to cite archival materials in their research
 
Typically, numbering is done toward the end of processing because folders are often relocated during processing.

### Oversize folder numbering 
Numbers on oversize folders should follow this format:
OSx-1.1

### Map case folder numbering
Folders stored in the map cases should be numbered in the following format:
[“Map Case”]  [letter designation as to which file bank]  [drawer #] . [folder #]
Example:	MC A 1.1

### Hive storage numbering
For rolled materials that are housed in one of the Hives:

Rolls should be protected by an exterior roll layer of acid free, unbuffered paper.

Write the same kind of information on the roll as you would on a folder, on the horizontal left edge (so that when you pull the tube out partially from the hive, you can easily see the label).

Example:	Hive B 2.15

## Folder Titling
Folder titles should begin at the far left top corner (or, on oversize folders, on the bottom left corner). Folder titles should match the description of that material in AT. If the material from one series or file takes up more than one folder, follow the title with “1 of x” (x being the number of folders containing material of that description.)

For large series or folders that have a repeated title (or part of title), create a stamp for the repeated part, to eliminate having to write it over and over again. During processing, you can use a shorthand in pencil on the folder—when ready, create the stamp with the series/repeated title on the stamp at the appropriate level beneath the collection title.

## Folder stamping
There is a stamp available that can be altered for assigning the name of collections to each folder. The stamp includes the repository name, collection name, and collection number. Ask Anna, Agnes, Wendy or Jenny to show you how to make a new stamp. Everything should be removed from a folder before stamping it.
