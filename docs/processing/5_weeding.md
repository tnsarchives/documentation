Sometimes it is appropriate to remove and discard items in a collection. Below is a general guide to what can be discarded. If you are unsure whether to discard something, ask. Any paper-based material being discarded that originated from The New School should be shredded. A box for collecting material to be shredded is located under the assistant archivist’s desk.

The archives does not retain documents that are considered letters of transmittal or documents concerning routine transactions, unless they are attached to or part of a group of materials that depend upon the transmittal letter for context. What does this mean? Standard, template-type responses to common requests. For example, cover letters send with a catalog when someone writes and requests a catalog. Acknowledgement letters when there is some other record of a gift or donation. Large numbers of the exact same letter with only the addressee changed. In these cases, a sample is sufficient. 

If there are too many duplicates of certain material they are weeded. This depends on the date and format of the material. See the manual “Processing: Description in Archivists Toolkit” for a detailed guide to weeding based on format and age. If you have any questions about a particular situation, ask.
