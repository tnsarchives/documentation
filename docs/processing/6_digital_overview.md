## Non-Removable Digital Material 
Digital archivist performs fixity checks at moment of file transfer/download to shared drive. Preferable mode of transfer is via external hard drive, rather than Google docs, FTP, Dropbox, or email. 

Inventory (when provided) and born-digital files should be held in the Digital_accessions_to_be_processed folder ("K:\working_files\Digital_accessions_to_be_processed").

File naming conventions. Clean up file names for offending characters, but otherwise keep file names as provided. The content of files with ambiguous names will be clarified by finding aid metadata.

## Removable Media
When possible, appraisal should be carried out prior to disk imaging. This will cut down on media processing time, labeling, etc.
