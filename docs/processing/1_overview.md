## Introduction to Archival Processing

Processing is the work archives workers carry out in preparation for providing archival collections to researchers.

It includes physical work, such as protecting and storing materials, as well as intellectual work, including analyzing and writing descriptions of the materials. This manual will describe the physical work involved in processing. See the manual “Processing: Description” for information on the other piece of processing. 

Archival materials can be analog, such as paper, videotape, audio cassettes, fabric samples, or film/photographic materials. They can also be digital, such as computer files. You will work with both analog and digital materials in the Archives.

Processing of analog materials sometimes includes re-housing materials in acid-free folders and boxes, removing paper clips, dividing overfilled folders, labeling folders with pencil, putting identifying stamps on the folders, etc.

For some small collections, this is a very simple task that may be completed in less than a day. For other larger or more complex collections, you may work on processing tasks for a week or more. You may also finish processing a collection someone else started.
