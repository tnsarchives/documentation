## Logging and Tracking Oral History Interviews

### IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING INTERVIEW

-Receiving archives staff member transfers wav files from disk and create MP3s from wav files
-Name files following oral history naming convention:
[coll no.]_[last name]_[date of interview: yyyymmdd]_[serial no.], If an interview spans 2 consecutive days, use day 1 date. If an interview takes place over non-consecutive days, treat as separate interviews.
-When multiple interviews exist on the same physical media, digital sound files should be split in an audio editor so that there are separate files for each interview. This should happen as soon as possible after these interviews are conducted.
-Place files in Audio_preservation (wavs) and Audio_access (MP3s) directories
-Enter file name and date into Oral_History_Tracking document on shared drive under Tracking: K:\working_files\Central_Kellen_share\Collection_management\Tracking. All in-progress files are highlighted green. Update tracking document with date and initials when transcript has been created and other actions, such as transcript reviews, have been completed. When all steps are complete the green fill should be removed.
-Raw biographical info (e.g., CV, images provided by interviewee) should be placed in "Bios" folder of collection file.
-Alert Wendy/Jenny that this has been done and is ready to be transcribed. They hire transcriber (usually outsourced to Audio Transcription Center.)
