[Need to refine this to address removable media, and instances where the files will not be renamed.]

-Append unique identifier to each file using Bulk Rename Utility.
-Determine whether any information in the original filename will need to be included. For MFA theses, it is useful to refer to the included title list.
-Titles and additional designators should be all lowercase.
-For more recent submissions, the students’ NetID will be used. For earlier submissions, use a shortened version of each student’s name, first initial + last name (ie. KWatson).
-Designate the main thesis document with “_pg1” and the accompanying image list with “_pg2” (ie. “PC020403_2013_KWatson_ThesisStatement” becomes “PC020403_2013_KWatson_pg1”). If one file contains both document, rename with the unique identifier only (ie. “PC020403_2013_KWatson”).
