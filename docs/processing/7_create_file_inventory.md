## Karen’s Directory Printer 

When the born-digital files have been transferred and all fixity checks are completed, the digital archivist should create an inventory of the files as they originally arrived at the archive for future reference. 

Put the PDF into the collection directory on the shared drive (this is a place for various accession information, same place where the inventory created by the department of origin goes). 
1. Open Karen’s Directory Printer from the Karen’s Power Tools folder.
2. Choose the Print tab on the top of the window.
3. Select the folder of files to be processed.
4. Under Print Options select “Both Files & Folders” and “Search Sub-Folders.”
5. Under File Info check “File Name,” “Date Last Modified” and “File Size” (along with any other file info as desired).
6. Make sure “Sort Files by:” is set to “Don’t Sort.”

Then click the Print button and use the accession number for the file name.
In the print dialog, select save as PDF
Print in landscape orientation.
