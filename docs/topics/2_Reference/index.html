<ul>
<li>Monday through Friday, 10 am until 5 pm, by confirmed appointment</li>
<li>No exceptions to these days and hours unless authorized by Wendy</li>
<li>If researchers show up without an appointment, welcome them inside if convenient or explain that they will need to return later (for example, if a class or a meeting is in progress).</li>
<li>“Reading room” is the front of the office in 66 Fifth Avenue. Consultation of physical archival collections does not occur anywhere else on campus.</li>
<li>Make sure that researchers understand where we are located. A significant number assume Archives and Special Collections (hereafter ASC) is in the University Center at 63 Fifth Avenue, or veteran Parsons researchers may still think we’re in 2 West 13th Street.</li>
<li>Here is a sample generic response illustrating our in-house style for first-time patrons:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Dear [Patron's First Name, or however they identify themselves in their initial communication]</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for contacting The New School Archives regarding your research on [whatever topic they identified in their initial communication].</em></p>
<p><em>If you would like to make an appointment for later this week or next week, please consult the finding aid for this collection and advise which boxes you would like to examine: [include full URL, do not insert link into body of text]</em></p>
<p><em>We require two business days notice to retrieve the boxes and have them delivered to the Archives.</em></p>
<p><em>Please let us know if you have any questions.</em></p>
<p>*Also attach the &quot;Welcome&quot; document for first-time visitors. (“New_School_Archives_WELCOME” saved here: K:\working_files\Central_Kellen_share\Forms-Blank_Signs)</p>

<ul>
<li>Researchers may inquire about also using the library collections (non-Special Collections). Unless they have a newcard (The New School identity card), they cannot use the main library collections; there is no “Friend of the Library” program; donations and memberships will not get someone into the TNS Libraries. There are two exceptions:
<ul>
<li>The Hannah Arendt Terminal (see more info below)</li>
<li>The Reiner Schurmann lectures on open shelves in List Center Library (6 East 16th Street). Visiting researchers may consult these volumes, but ASC needs to coordinate with the circulation desk at List so the researcher can enter the building without a newcard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New School Alumni should be encouraged to apply for their Alumni Benefits card so they can use the Libraries. Access and User Services (AUS), which sets this policy, considers “alumni” to be graduates of degree programs only. The form can be accessed at the following link: <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/alumni/card/">https://www.newschool.edu/alumni/card/</a></li>
<li>For non-New School alumni offer to help these researchers locate copies of the materials they are seeking through NYPL, or WorldCat</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>See FAQ: How do I make an appointment to use the Hannah Arendt archives at the New School?</li>
<li>Example of stock response:</li>
</ul>
<p>Dear [Researcher],</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting the New School Archives regarding access to the Hannah Arendt papers.</p>
<p>Access to the digitized Arendt papers is through a designated computer terminal in The New School's List Center Library. It is available whenever the List Center Library is open. You can use the following link to determine opening and closing hours on the days you wish to visit: <a href="http://library.newschool.edu/hours.php">http://library.newschool.edu/hours.php</a></p>
<p>While we make no provisions for reserving a space at the terminal, if anyone if using the terminal for purposes other than accessing the Arendt papers when you arrive, they are required to relinquish the terminal to Arendt researchers.
The List Center Library is located on the 8th floor of The New School's 6 East 16th Street building. When you arrive at the entrance to 6 East 16th Street, inform the security guard at the front desk that you are there to use the Hannah Arendt terminal in the List Center Library. The guard will call the library and a library staff member will come down to meet you.</p>
<p>For your reference, I am providing a link from our Libraries and Archives online FAQ that addresses the Arendt papers: <a href="http://answers.library.newschool.edu/faq/68298">http://answers.library.newschool.edu/faq/68298</a></p>
<p>The New School's archives and special collections unit is in a different building, but feel free to contact us if we can be of assistance to you during your visit to our campus.</p>
<p>With all good wishes,
Jenny Swadosh
Associate Archivist</p>

<ul>
<li>Our generic e-mail account is <a href="mailto:archivist@newschool.edu">archivist@newschool.edu</a></li>
<li>Always claim a question with your designated icon if you are going to be answering it.</li>
<li>If you are “on duty” for e-mail reference, it is your responsibility to monitor the archivist account on that day. No incoming e-mails should remain unclaimed at the end of the day. You are also responsible for incoming e-mails that were received the previous day after the archives closed.</li>
<li>If answering a question from your personal account, copy archivist or special collections account as needed. Remind researcher that, in the future, using the archivist account may result in faster response.</li>
<li>Record patron in Filemaker database as soon as request comes in. Don’t wait.</li>
<li>Do not log referrals to librarians, if that is all you do. There must be some significant archival component to the reference request for it to be logged into Filemaker</li>
<li>Update it each time you interact with a researcher. Do not under-report!</li>
<li>See specific instructions in “Workflow: Filemaker Researcher Log”</li>
<li>File e-mail in appropriate folder in Gmail as needed. Don’t leave it in the inbox unless it is still active.</li>
<li>When using e-mail, be mindful that a large percent of our researchers speak English as a second language. Consider breaking long, complex sentences into more, easily understandable sentences. Break long messages into multiple shorter ones. Avoid idioms. Ask Jenny if you’re interested in learning more about this issue.</li>
<li>Always offer phone or in-person consultation. Some researchers may not feel comfortable using e-mail.</li>
<li>Assistant Archivist is responsible for setting the “Out of Office” automated response on Friday evenings, advising that the ASC is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. Also responsible for automated messages during holidays.</li>
<li>If a question is forwarded to the archivist e-mail account from LibAnswers (it will display as being sent by &quot;Ask Us&quot;) by a member of the Library staff, notify Jenny so she can log into the LibAnalytics system and &quot;close out&quot; the ticket. Otherwise, the library staff will not know if the question has been answered or not.</li>

<ol>
<li>Upon first response to researcher inquiry, enter into FileMaker Researcher log immediately. See instructions for doing so above in the section Email Account.</li>
<li>Confirm that the researcher needs to visit in person</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is collection digitized and on Digital Collections site?</li>
<li>Must they use the archives or will any primary source suffice?
<ul>
<li>Students and faculty are frequently confused about what primary sources are. You may need to explain that articles in a database can, indeed, be primary sources. It depends on how they’re being used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some students may be required to visit the archives as part of a graded assignment. We discourage this practice among faculty, but we can’t turn students away if faculty have already issued assignment prompts (unless it becomes a problem).
<ul>
<li>Faculty who consult ASC in advance are encouraged to counsel students in proper e-mail etiquette. Forward them this blog post for review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If it turns out they do not need to use the ASC, you may refer them to TNS Libraries
<ul>
<li>If referring researcher to TNS Libraries, always use libhelp address (<a href="mailto:LibHelp@newschool.edu">LibHelp@newschool.edu</a>) or direct them to chat if the chat function is online. Do not instruct them to call or e-mail an individual librarian. You can copy that librarian on your e-mail message so he/she is aware that someone may be contacting them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are forwarding a message to the TNS librarians, send it directly to <a href="mailto:libhelp@newschool.edu">libhelp@newschool.edu</a> without commentary</li>
<li>When mentioning library policies and procedures, ALWAYS include LibAnswers FAQ link if appropriate. Always offer opportunity for further explanation, answering of questions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Confirm ASC hours and time required to conduct research</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Students should understand that they are visiting for at least 30 minutes. They cannot just breeze in and out, or “stop by.”</li>
<li>If collections are offsite, communicate to researcher the lead time necessary to place a delivery in time for their visit. If necessary, require researchers to consult a finding aid and make specific box selections, especially if they wish to examine a large collection. Don’t just call in a ton of boxes and hope for the best.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Discuss what materials they will be using</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In general, when making suggestions of collections for students, less is more. Only offer them two (ideal) or three options for collections. If they want to explore further, they can make a return appointment.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Scheduling the appointment</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Two researchers may use the reading room simultaneously, although they should not be scheduled to arrive at the same time. Stagger arrivals by 30 minutes.</li>
<li>If one researcher is actually a group, which is common among students, do not schedule them simultaneously with another lone researcher.</li>
<li>If a group is already scheduled and a lone researcher requests an appointment at the same time, inquire if he/she is okay with sharing the reading room with a group.</li>
<li>Add the appointment to Google Calendar “Researchers and Visitors” account. The title of the appointment should follow this format: “Researcher: [Researcher’s Name] (research topic).”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Send researcher “Welcome” document for review prior to visit</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is saved on the Central Kellen Share Drive in the directory titled, &quot;Forms-Blank_signs.&quot;</li>
<li>Title of document is, &quot;New_School_Archives_WELCOME.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>Follow up with researcher 48 hours prior to appointment</li>
</ol>
<p>Dear [PATRON NAME],</p>
<p>I am writing to confirm your appointment for DAY OF WEEK, MONTH DATE, at TIME.
If you can no longer keep this appointment or you need to reschedule, please contact us immediately.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you on DAY OF WEEK.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask inquiring instructors and departmental administrators for information on class</li>

<ul>
<li>Some instruction requests may come in via the library’s AskUs forms and then transferred to ASC without the instructor knowing the path that their request has taken. Be aware of this when responding to faculty requests for instruction.</li>
<li>Days and times that class meets</li>
<li>Location of classroom</li>
<li>Number of students in class or group</li>
<li>Instructor’s objectives for visit to/use of ASC (what do they want ASC staff to cover?)</li>

</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Schedule an in-person or a phone meeting with instructor to select materials or confirm your suggestions</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Some instructors will not care and will leave selection entirely to archivists, while others may make their own research appointments to carefully evaluate selections.</li>
<li>Remember that many instructors have never used archives themselves. They may not know what finding aids are. It is better to provide more information to instructors rather than assuming they are familiar and comfortable using archives.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Schedule the class visit</li>

<ul>
<li>We host class visits during our normal hours of operation, 10 am – 5 pm. Any exceptions must be authorized by Wendy.</li>
<li>Maximum number of students actively working with archival collections is capped at 15. Larger classes must be divided in half for a visit.</li>
<li>Typically only one class visit to the archives is reserved per day. First-come-first-served basis.</li>
<li>Schedule the appointment with extra time at the beginning and end of the class visit to prep and wrap up. Researchers should not be scheduled right up to or immediately following a class visit.</li>
<li>Add the appointment to Google Calendar “Researchers and Visitors” account. The title of the appointment should follow this format: “Class Visit: [instructor name]: ([name of class]).” In the Description field of the Google Calendar event, include information about collections being used or any other relevant information.</li>
<li>If the instruction session only consists of you visiting a classroom and the class is not coming to the archives, do not enter it in the Google Calendar under &quot;Researchers and Visitors.&quot; Enter it under &quot;Staff Schedules.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Send the instructor a reminder with the following information:
<em>Please help us care for our school’s resources by reminding your students that no beverage containers of any kind are permitted in the Archives, even “spill-proof” ones and water bottles. Food and beverage containers may stay in backpacks or bags on the floor.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>We ask visitors to thoroughly wash and dry their hands (no hand sanitizer) prior to handling collections. Restrooms are located right outside The New School Archives in the lobby of 66 Fifth Avenue.</em></p>
<p><em>We do not permit the use of any writing implements except pencils around the collections. We have a supply of pencils for visitor use. Cameras are permitted for taking reference images as are notebooks and sketchbooks.</em></p>
<p><em>We maintain a temperature of approximately 69 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year for the preservation of archival materials. This is somewhat cooler than average classroom temperatures, so we encourage visitors to dress appropriately for their own comfort.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Meet researchers at the door, or at the guard’s desk as the case may be.</li>
<li>Ask for confirmation on how to pronounce their names and make sure to address them by name throughout their visit. Pay attention to how correspondents sign off on their e-mails. Use that name, not necessarily what is in their official e-mail address. This is very important for students who have chosen names for themselves.</li>
<li>Direct them to an empty locker marked “Visitors” for storing their bags, coats, etc.</li>
<li>If it is their first visit to ASC, have them fill out the Registration form</li>
<li>Immediately enter pertinent information into Filemaker Patron Log (for instructions see Workflow: Filemaker Research Log_IN PROGRESS)</li>
<li>After logging the patron in Filemaker, file physical agreement in drawer.</li>
<li>Do NOT under any condition leave the agreement on countertop or your desk.</li>
<li>Offer to plug in their laptops for them. They shouldn’t have to crawl around on the floor looking for the outlet.</li>
<li>Advise that, although they are welcome to have their phones out for image capture, they may not take calls in the reading room. Settings should be on silent mode. Don’t be reticent about enforcing this. They are welcome to leave the room to answer a call, and we will buzz them back in. They do not need to request permission first.</li>
<li>Inform them where restroom is located. Point out pencil sharpener (make sure it is plugged in). Offer them pencils.</li>
<li>Explain scanning policy.  An old policy is available on our website. The new policy is saved in K:\working_files\Central_Kellen_share\Procedures_Guidelines_Workflows_Policies\Patrons_Public_Svc_Scanning (“Reproduction_Revisions_20180717_FINAL”)</li>
<li>Physically demonstrate the flagging procedure for them. It is difficult to comprehend unless they see it being done. Explain that you will review their scan requests with them before they leave, so they should leave time for that review.</li>
<li>If you are “on duty,” you should not be wearing headphones. You must be aware of the researchers’ requests for assistance, both through visual and oral cues. You must be able to see the researcher from where you are sitting.</li>
<li>Move chairs out of their way, especially if researchers are working with oversize flat boxes.</li>
<li>Never assume that the researcher knows what he or she is doing. Take the time to explain basic procedures and physically demonstrate, for example, how to remove a folder from a box. If a researcher is looking at very large material, it may be necessary to assist the researcher in viewing it. Point out box labels and suggest that the researcher take photos for forming citations later. This is especially helpful for researchers whose native language isn’t English, but should be used for everyone conducting research.</li>
<li>Remind researchers of impending closing time at 4:45 pm. Inquire if they would like to return the following day (unless the schedule does not allow). Leave time at the end of the their visit to review any scan requests they have made:</li>
<li>Every batch of requests should be flagged. The researcher’s initials, the date, and the number of pages requested to be scanned should be written on each flag.</li>
<li>The flags should be consecutively numbered starting with 1 for each request</li>
<li>If they are required to pay for their scans (because they are non-New School researchers or have exceeded their scan allotment) determine how much the scans will cost (see Reproduction_Revisions_20180717_FINAL in K:\working_files\Central_Kellen_share\Procedures_Guidelines_Workflows_Policies\Patrons_Public_Svc_Scanning). If they would like to pay for the scans on the spot, offer them an onvoice.</li>
<li>For more information on processing scan requests see Workflow: Scan Requests_IN PROGRESS</li>
<li>After the conclusion of the visit, inquire if researcher has any questions. Inform them that they are encouraged to follow up by e-mail or phone regarding citation help.</li>
<li>Put the boxes away before you leave for the day, unless the researcher will be continuing with their research the next morning, or if the boxes are to be returned to offsite storage the next morning.</li>

<ul>
<li>All Special Collections material is stored off-site.</li>
<li>Patrons request Special Collections material by e-mailing <a href="mailto:speccoll@newschool.edu">speccoll@newschool.edu</a></li>
<li>If item exists in Main Collections, researcher must use that copy and not Special Collections copy.</li>
<li>If researcher needs item urgently (as is often the case with student researchers), use WorldCat to locate other libraries in NYC that hold the item. Offer to help student interpret records as it may their first time using another institution’s library.</li>
<li>All Special Collections material must first be delivered from off-site to the ASC and from here to the University Center (UC) Library Circulation Desk.</li>
<li>Sometimes requests for dissertations are sent to the speccoll@ account, they should be referred to the Libraries FAQ: <a href="http://answers.library.newschool.edu/faq/68277">http://answers.library.newschool.edu/faq/68277</a>. Patrons may require assistance using the Proquest database and locating a specific dissertation. Help them locate the dissertation and explain how you did it; do not send them back to librarians.</li>

<ol>
<li>Locate item by checking the ALEPH item record. Note that access to the back-end of ALEPH requires training, certification, and a personal log-in.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the record is for the item held by The New School Special Collections, not another consortium library</li>
<li>Navigate to the MARC view of the item record and locate the barcode</li>
<li>If the item has a barcode that does not begin with 31207…, it is likely not a valid barcode, which means it is not traceable and we don’t know where it is.</li>
<li>In particular, watch for barcodes that begin with the letter “N.” I like to think the “n” stands for “not findable.” There is no actual barcode beginning with “N”; these numbers were used for items that had been stored in an area of the old Fogelman Library.</li>
<li>Also, sometimes catalogers use number sequences in the barcode field for expected items that we don’t have yet. They can often be identified by a dash between two sets of numbers. If you see this type of barcode in an item record, check with Tech Services as they may have additional information about the item.</li>
<li>Items that were formerly in Gimbel Library (mainly artists’ books, photography books, and older monographs and serials) and were sent offsite in boxes will not be recallable by their item-level barcode. If there is a red check in the item record field “Notes,” it’s a good indicator that further location information will be found below.</li>
<li>If this is the case, check our Offsite Filemaker database to see if the box is still offsite or if it is in Tech Services with Christian Loor or Vincent Kelley. If it’s with Christian or Vincent, e-mail them to inquire if they still have the item on the shelves by their respective desks.</li>
<li>One last place a missing item might be is on the Special Collections “to-be-cataloged” shelves in Tech Services. Check the Google Doc spreadsheet to see if the item is there</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Respond to patron</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If request came in to an account that is not <a href="mailto:speccoll@newschool.edu">speccoll@newschool.edu</a>, forward the request to that account and reply from speccoll@</li>
<li>Once you know how long it will take to deliver the item to the UC Circulation Desk, you can then respond to the patron.</li>
<li>If it is taking more than 24 hours to figure things out with the Circulation staff, acknowledge the patron request and advise them that someone is looking into it. Offer to find alternative libraries for the patron if necessary (“This book is at the New York Public Library, if you need to consult it urgently…”).</li>
<li>Copy the UC Circulation Desk on all emails (<a href="mailto:librarycirc@newschool.edu">librarycirc@newschool.edu</a>).</li>
<li>Never write to an individual AUS staff member.</li>
<li>Appointments at the UC Circulation Desk can be made Monday-Friday, 8am-1pm, except during the summer when the library opens later.</li>
<li>Use the following language to reply to the patron:</li>
</ul>
<p>Dear [PATRON],</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us regarding your interest in this book.</p>
<p>It is in offsite storage but can be requested for you to use by appointment in the University Center Library. Please inform us which day and time you would be available for an appointment. We require 3 business days’ notice to retrieve the item and have it delivered to the library. Appointments can be scheduled between 8 am and 1 pm, Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>Note that the book cannot be photocopied or scanned. You are, however, welcome to photograph the pages.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>[YOUR NAME]</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not request an item until the appointment is set</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Recall item from offsite storage</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use FileMaker-generated email to request item from offsite storage</li>
<li>Because Special Collections items are not managed through Filemaker (except certain boxed items from the old Parsons library), you will need to add them to the Filemaker generated e-mail for deliveries. For e-mail purposes, you may refer to these barcodes as describing “items.”</li>
<li>See instructions Workflow: Filemaker Offsite Database</li>
<li>Use the barcode found in the ALEPH item record</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Send item from ASC to the University Center Circulation Desk</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Each item must have a processing slip accompanying it.</li>
<li>Processing slips will be found on the Central Kellen Share in the directory titled, &quot;Forms-Blank_signs.&quot; The file is called “processingslip081715”</li>
<li>Fill out a processing slip with the patron’s name in the field for “HOLD.”</li>
<li>Include the Bib System # and Barcode.</li>
<li>Initial and date the slip, with a note at the bottom, “Return to Archives.”</li>
<li>Ask a student worker to deliver it to the UC Circulation Desk, and email the <a href="mailto:librarycirc@newschool.edu">librarycirc@newschool.edu</a> address to alert them that the item has been delivered to the UC.</li>
<li>If the patron requests multiple items or large, heavy items email Lyndon (<a href="mailto:AcheeL@newschool.edu">AcheeL@newschool.edu</a>) at AUS Delivery Services to coordinate an “intralibrary transfer.”</li>
<li>If using Delivery Services, give Lyndon and his staff ample time (several days’ notice) to schedule the delivery, and also let them know how many crates they will need to bring with them. Print out a packing slip to accompany the deliveries. Templates can be found on the Central Kellen Share in the &quot;Special Collections&quot; directory.</li>
<li>Lyndon will almost always respond to email messages with a phone confirmation to schedule the delivery.</li>
<li>It is the responsibility of the UC Circulation Desk staff to return the Special Collections items to the Archives in 66 Fifth Avenue. Special Collections items should never be scheduled for a Clancy pick-up from 63 Fifth Avenue.</li>

<ul>
<li>Occasionally, faculty will request Special Collections items for classroom use. If the class is smaller than 13 (including instructors), they may book a Collaboration Room in the UC Library for reviewing the items. This form on the TNS Libraries homepage will allow faculty to do this themselves. Do not assume that they know about this service.</li>
<li>If the class is larger than 12 but not larger than 15, the instructor may make an appointment for the class to visit the Archives during our regular business hours (see &quot;Scheduling Class Visits&quot;)</li>
<li>If using Special Collections items without librarian or archivist supervision, the instructor will need to complete a form (see “SpecialCollectionsGuidelinesandAgreement” saved in K:\working_files\Central_Kellen_share\Agreement-Templates_Licensing_Rights) that releases the Special Collections items to him or her:</li>
<li>That release form should be provided to the instructor by ASC staff via email, and a hard copy should also accompany the item when it is delivered to the UC Library.</li>
<li>UC Library Circulation Desk staff are not to provide any Special Collections item to a faculty member unless the form is completed.</li>
<li>The faculty member must return the item immediately after the conclusion of the class on the same day he/she borrowed it.</li>
<li>Sometimes a class request comes through a librarian (almost always multiple issues of Visionaire or a selection of photography books). They are responsible for the items once delivered to the UC Library and do not need to complete the release form. They will usually request that the items be delivered to their office and this may need to be coordinated with Lyndon and the Delivery Services staff. Coordinate delivery and pick-up with the requesting librarian and Lyndon, copying all parties so everyone is on the same page.</li>
<li>In the past, Fashion Studies MA students have requested large runs of the oversized serial, American Fabrics, and we have suggested that they consult it in the Archives as there is no room behind the UC Circulation Desk for these volumes. Typically, students will be consulting these in groups over a period of several days</li>

<ul>
<li>Always identify “New School Archives” when picking up a call.</li>
<li>Always take caller’s name, phone number and email address. Repeat information back to caller to confirm.</li>
<li>If you need to investigate something, advise that you’ll call back, but if they don’t hear from you by [insert target date], they should follow up.</li>
<li>Many callers are inquiring for help using the Digital Collections site. Be prepared to walk them through it, step by step. The following document was developed for this purpose: K:\working_files\Central_Kellen_share\Digital Archives\Digital_CollectiveAccess\Instructions for Researchers</li>
<li>We receive many misdirected calls. Be prepared to transfer a call, but also give the caller the direct number in case the call is disconnected. Gently remind the caller that submitting a request through LibHelp email may be more expedient than calling a TNS Libraries staff member.</li>
<li>Circulation desk general number is x4121. Let caller know that the individual who picks up that number may need to transfer them again.</li>
<li>Check voicemail messages when you arrive in the morning.</li>
<li>After the call is completed, log relevant patron information in FileMaker, unless you are simply making a referral.</li>

<ul>
<li>DON’T MAKE ANY PROMISES. Ask potential donor re: formats (archival collection, books, periodicals, garments?), age, extent, and current location of donation. Take down detailed contact information (phone AND email). Inquire about donor’s relationship to The New School (alum?, former faculty, etc.?)</li>
<li>You are not authorized to accept a donation. Advise potential donor that someone will get back to them and thank them for thinking of the ASC.</li>
<li>If you can determine that the donation is more suited for the library, see library donation FAQ or refer the donor to the FAQ (<a href="http://answers.library.newschool.edu/faq/68250">http://answers.library.newschool.edu/faq/68250</a>). For instance, we frequently get calls about donating old periodicals--refer these to the library. (Sometimes donors assume that because what they want to give us is old, the archives is the appropriate venue.)</li>

<ul>
<li>Researcher should have individual’s name (including various permutations) and approximate date of enrollment.</li>
<li>Refer to Terry Biggs (<a href="mailto:BiggsT@newschool.edu">BiggsT@newschool.edu</a>)</li>
<li>Must state that they are seeking “directory information.&quot; More information about what Office of Registrar can and cannot provide will be found on the Registrar web pages, including what &quot;directory information&quot; consists of:</li>
<li>Field of Study/Major</li>
<li>Dates of Attendance</li>
<li>Enrollment Status (FT or PT)</li>
<li>Degrees and Awards Obtained</li>
<li>Most Recent Educational Attendance</li>
<li>Address While Attending New School</li>
<li>Place and Date of Birth</li>
<li>Alert the researcher that it may take several weeks to obtain information. Invite them to copy the archivist email account on all their communications.</li>
<li>Offer to follow up on researcher’s behalf if researcher does not receive answer in one month. We have experienced difficulty obtaining consistent answers from the Office of the Registrar, so it is important to act as the researcher's advocate in these cases.</li>

<ul>
<li>We will conduct up to one hour of research on behalf of a remote patron. After one hour, they need to either schedule a visit or arrange for a “research surrogate” to come in their place.</li>
<li>Generally, we ask student workers to conduct this research. The student worker should be careful to note their start and end times and advise what they examined so this information can be conveyed to the patron.</li>
<li>Sample email language (with different phrasing options):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Another alternative is asking someone you know here in New York who could visit us in person and take photographs of the documents. We do not charge patrons for this, and we would assist your &quot;research surrogate&quot; so that they would know exactly what to photograph.</li>
<li>If you cannot come here in person, we recommend that you find someone here in the U.S. who can conduct this research on your behalf. Your &quot;research surrogate&quot; can take reference photographs for you free of charge.</li>
<li>In the past, we have suggested that international researchers locate a surrogate researcher here in the New York area to visit us and take reference photographs of materials with a digital camera. We do not charge researchers when they use their cameras for taking research photographs. Do you know someone who could visit us on your behalf?</li>
<li>[For Special Collections item] One solution that several international researchers have used is to find a friend or associate here in New York willing to act as a &quot;surrogate&quot; researcher. The surrogate can make an appointment to consult the dissertation in our library at 63 Fifth Avenue (New York City), photograph it free of charge, and then supply the images to the original researcher.</li>

<p>There are several resources on the ASC website that may be useful to resources. Direct them to the “Research Resources” section, and from there the New School History page. The “More Information” section contains various lists compiled over time, such as lists of administrators and name changes.</p>
<p>Researchers seeking more information about the division now known as NSSR should be informed that the Rockefeller Archive Center has more documentation about individual scholars than the New School Archives.</p>
<p>Also be aware that documentation for all divisions prior to World War II is spotty to non-existent. Publications are frequently the only early documents that we have.</p>

<li>Rutkoff &amp; Scott’s The New School: A History of The New School for Social Research, while more comprehensive, is also problematic. Researchers should read it with a grain of salt. It is probably fine for researchers seeking basic information such as chronologies.</li>
<li>For an overview of the Mobilization of the 1990s, Eyal Press’s Nightmare on 12th Street, written for Lingua Franca, is a blow-by-blow account, although clearly biased against the protestors</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Alumni Association records (pre-1970 only)</li>
<li>Various alumni newsletters in periodicals collection (pre and post-1970)</li>
