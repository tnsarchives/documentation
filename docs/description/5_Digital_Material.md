The protocols for managing optical media and disks are still under review. At the moment, they are most fully described in Workflow: Hybrid and Born-Digital Collections_IN PROGRESS.

As regards describing digital material in AT, for removal media, add a note in Repository Processing Note at the component level indicating the disk identifier or range of identifiers (ie: “[DISK REMOVED TO ARNHOLD HALL: 2012NS22_D001]”). Once digital files have been processed, add location of disk as instance(s); if files have been deaccessioned, remove note from Repository Processing and add it as a Deaccession note. 

If digital files have not yet been processed when finding aid is published, indicate in collection-level processing note that digital files are in process. If disk [or box/folder of disks] are not associated with a folder, create a separate item-level component with the disk identifier within the resource record -- associate with an existing series if one can be determined, otherwise create temporary disks series.

For instructions on how to associate digital objects on Collective Access with the finding aid for that collection, see section “Other Finding Aids Note.”
