title: Component-level Description
---

Collections are broken up into various components, from series (largest component) to item (smallest component). To create a new component in AT, click on the collection/series/subseries on the left side of the window and click the “Add Child” button below. This will allow you to create new description for that component.

Each component must have the following:
Level
Title
Date

Components often also have their own Scope & Content note. When adding a Scope & Content note to a component, delete the title “Scope and Content note” in the label field and replace with two underscores (“__”). This will make the note render properly when the finding aid is exported from AT.

Instances are also added to components to describe where to find the material described. With the exception of digital object instances and some minimally processed collections, the instance is added to the lowest-level component (the file or item). Instructions for adding instances will be found in the Archivists Toolkit manual.


## Level
Select the appropriate level for the component you are describing. The most commonly used are series, subseries, files, and items. Below are definitions of each drawn from the Society of American Archivists’ glossary:
Series = A group of similar records that are arranged according to a filing system and that are related as the result of being created, received, or used in the same activity; a file group; a record series
Subseries = A body of documents within a series readily distinguished from the whole by filing arrangement, type, form, or content.
File = A group of documents related by use or topic, typically housed in a folder (or a group of folders for a large file).
Item = A thing that can be distinguished from a group and that is complete in itself.

## Titles
In collection inventory, place the word “Series” and the series number in front of the series title in AT (the arrangement note adds the number automatically).
Example:    Series I. Subject files

For any title below the collection-level, the title of the component should include the date in the following format: [component name], [component date]. Note that for files and items the date is included here instead of in the date expression field (see dates for more information).
Example:    Book projects, 1920-1977

### Dates in titles
When the title of a folder contains a date that is not referring to the creation dates of the records in the folder then that date should be enclosed in parentheses prior to the inclusive dates of document creation of items in folder.

This is not only for events or exhibition—it may be a semester or season (for clothing).

Examples:    Salute to Henry Cohen (1984 Jan 26), 1983-1984
"It's Happening!": merger dinner and fashion show (1979 Jun 15), 1978-1979

### Multiple folders/components with exactly same title
For multiple folders with exactly the same title, list only once and include folder range in the instance entry in AT. If the folders are all in the same box, do not put “1 of 2” designation in AT  but do write these designations on the actual folders.

If multiple folders with the same title span two boxes, then list as per the following example:
Box 2, Folder 15-16       Kellen archival materials, 1-2 of 3

For multiple folders that share the first part of a title, in AT: When title repeats 3+ times--whether it is a series, subseries, or other category, make the repeating part of the title a parent and place the others underneath as children with the title removed.
Example:    Instead of:
Institute for the Study of Contemporary Society: Proposal, undated
Institute for the Study of Contemporary Society, 1992 - 1993
Institute for the Study of Contemporary Society, 1994
. . . 
Use:
Institute for the Study of Contemporary Society [parent]
Proposal, undated [child]
1992-1994 [child]

### Formatting and Style

The New School Archives generally follows Chicago Manual of Style rules for citation, punctuation, abbreviation, capitalization, etcetera, when these rules do not conflict with DACs or other authoritative sources that the Archives determines are preferable.

Initial capitalize only the first word of a series title, unless the title is a proper name, formal name of an event or title of a publication (e.g., book or article), in which case use headline caps.

Usually initial capitalize the first word after a colon; likewise, usually initial capitalize the first word after a double dash (M-dash) when the M-dash represents a break.

Example 1:    Personal materials: Awards and certificates
Example 2:    Book projects: Diary of a Century by Jacques Henri Lartigue

To create italics use the following code: before the title use: <title render="italic">, after the title to be italicized use: </title>

Example:    <title render="italic">New world for old: a family migration</title>

For guidelines on the format of titles that are also the titles of works, such as books, exhibitions, periodicals, etc. see the style guide at the end of this manual.

## Dates
### Series, subseries, sub-subseries level
Follow the same rules for collection-level records when assigning dates to series, sub-series, sub-sub-series. Unlike at the collection level, “undated” can be used at the component-level if there is no clue to the date of the material. For series, subseries, and sub-subseries the date expression, inclusive date, and bulk date (if applicable) should all be completed. The date expression should match the inclusive and bulk dates at that level.  Follow the collection-level rules for doing so. (Only use the bulk date field at the series and lower levels if it is a large series with glaring outlier dates.)

### File level 
At the file level, do not use the date expression, inclusive or bulk date fields. Include the year-range of material within the folder in the title.
Example:    Collages and handmade cards, 1960s-1970s

### Item level
For single items only, record exact date in the following fashion at the file level: [year] [abbreviated month] [day].

Abbreviate months to the first three letters. Do not use punctuation in abbreviation:

Jan
Feb
Mar
Apr
May
Jun
Jul
Aug
Sep
Nov
Dec


Example:    1975 Mar 17

For single items with estimated dates use a consistent method of recording
Examples:       probably 1975
circa 1975
before 1975
after 1975
1975 or 1976
between 1975 and 1979 [no more than 20 years between the two dates]
1970s [no apostrophe]

If the date of publication differs from the dates covered by the content of the item express the coverage date in parentheses followed by a comma and then the date of publication.
Example:    Catalogue supplement (Spring 1960), 1959

## Instances
Each smallest component (file or item) should have an “instance” entered in AT. This assigns a physical location to the component. It allows the user to see what folder(s) or other container the material is housed in, and what box that folder lives in. Furthermore, instances are assigned shelf locations in the Archives’ compact shelving or designated as offsite. For materials in a box that is offsite the box barcode is added to the instance as well. For items going into a small flat box flat, retain sequential numbering with other regular-sized boxes, but indicate in the instance record that it is small flat, like this: Box: 4 (small flat). See the Archivists Toolkit manual for a detailed explanation of adding instances.

## Scope and Content Note
In certain collections, it is useful to indicate that photographs are present in a file. When this is the case, put this into a scope and content note at the folder (component) level: “Includes photo(s).”
If the material in the component being described is restricted, include the following statement: “This file is restricted. Please email archivist@newschool.edu for further information.” For more information on describing restrictions see below.
