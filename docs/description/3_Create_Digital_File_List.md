title: Create Digital File List

Create a list of digital files that can be uploaded to Google Drive and linked from a finding aid.
DROID makes PDFs that show directory tree, BUT Karen’s Directory Printer makes them more visually easy to read.

For digital appraisal, we should try out Tree-size Pro to analyze digital files and find duplicates, etc.

Determine file formats. 

Validate files -- good for checking transfer if checksums are not available.

Open DROID and click the large green plus-sign “Add” icon. Select the top-level directory of the files to be processed, and then click the blue “Start” icon. (May take several minutes.)

Right click the folder and choose “Expand to next three levels,” select all rows (ctrl-A on Windows), right click, then choose “Copy to clipboard.”

Open a blank sheet in Microsoft Excel and paste, typing in the the top row column headings manually.

Delete all columns except A (name), B (extension), C (size), D (date modified), F (format), G (version).
