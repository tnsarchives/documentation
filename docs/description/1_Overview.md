This manual provides guidelines for describing archival material in Archivist’s Toolkit. Each archival collection has a guide that provides information about the content and context of that collection. This guide is called a finding aid. 

Although The New School Archives has its own style and specifications for writing finding aids, there are also general rules for finding aids that apply to all collections. These rules are codified in “Describing Archives: A Content Standard,” otherwise known as DACS. The guidelines described below comply with DACS and have some further rules specific to The New School Archives.

The New School Archives uses a software called Archivists Toolkit (AT) to create finding aids. This manual includes some explanation on how to use AT. Further information on using AT can be found “Workflow for: Archivists Toolkit Processes”.
