Items are determined to be restricted according to the guidelines described in our Confidentiality Policy.

Create two identical separation sheets for each removed item, group of items, or folder.
­Separation sheets are found here:
Forms_Blanks_Signs/ItemOut_Separation_Restricted/ITEM_REMOVED_RESTRICTED_blank.
 - When an entire folder needs to be restricted, create 2 identical separation sheets, indicating the folder title to be restricted.
 - Save electronic version of separation sheet in the collection folder 
 - Remove folder from collection, placing one completed separation sheet in the place where the folder belongs in the box from which it is removed. Place the other separation sheet inside restricted folder (make sure collection name and number are stamped or written on the folder).
 - When there are only one (or two or three) items that need to be restricted in a folder that contains many other items that do not need to be restricted, create 2 identical separation sheets indicating the folder name and describing the restricted items.
 - Place restricted items into new folder, indicating collection name and number and folder title from which item was separated.
 - If there are items removed from multiple folders in a collection, do not put each item into a separate folder, rather, create a single folder that says, “Separated from the ______ collection,” and place all items into the new folder with a separation sheet in front of each restricted item indicating the folder it was removed from.
 - If there are enough restricted folders to call for having a restricted box(es) for a single collection, number the box as the last box(es) in that collection. Place orange “RESTRICTED” stickers on the box.
 - If there are not enough restricted folders to call for having a restricted box for a single collection, place restricted folders into a mixed restricted box.

## For unprocessed and in-process collections
 - Include this as the last sentence of the summary note: “Access is provided to this unprocessed record group, but some files may be restricted. Please email archivist@newschool.edu for details.”
 - Use bracketed [RESTRICTED] as part of collection/series/folder level title
 - Place warning notice to archivist in Repository Processing Note

## For processed or nearly-processed collections
 - Include this as the last sentence of the summary note: “Some files are restricted. Please email archivist@newschool.edu for details.”
 - For files whose title contains a person’s name that also may violate a person’s privacy, remove that person’s name from the title and place it in the Repository Processing Note at that level. See confidentiality policy for info on length of restriction  

   Example:   
**A file titled: “Jones, John. Grievance” should be retitled “Grievance”**

 - In finding aid, at collection level place a Conditions Governing Access note, use fuller statement regarding policy. Place note citing specific policy relevant to collection. 
 
    Example:    
 **“Collection is open for research use. Files containing student records are restricted for 120 years after person's known or estimated birth (or group of persons, like a class). Files with faculty or other personnel salary, performance reviews, hiring information are restricted for 50 years from creation date of item (or last creation date in file). Please contact archivist@newschool.edu for appointment.”**
 - In finding aid, also place note in the Scope & Content note at top-most level applicable to restricted material, e.g. ­if 3 or more folders in a series are restricted, place a restriction note at the series level; if one or two folders in a series are restricted, place note at folder-level.
 - For series/folder level scope and content note, use the more abbreviated wording as used in the collection summary.  
   
   Example:    
   **“This file is restricted. Please email archivist@newschool.edu for further information.”**
