The New School Archives uses Chicago Style for all notes and citations.

## Citations
We use bibliographic citations in finding aids to indicate an external source when it has been relied upon extensively for a biographical or scope and content note. When used, they should be included at the bottom of the note under the heading “References” and follow the format for bibliographic citation (as opposed to note format).

See Chicago Manual for explanations and more examples: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch14/ch14_sec018.html

Example:    
 - Rory Wolfe. “SMART-COP: A Tool for Predicting the Need for Intensive Respiratory or Vasopressor Support in Community-Acquired Pneumonia.” Clinical Infectious Diseases 47 (August 1, 2008): 375–84. Accessed July 17, 2008. doi:10.1086/589754.

 - Karmaus, Wilfried, and John F. Riebow. “Storage of Serum in Plastic and Glass Containers May Alter the Serum Concentration of Polychlorinated Biphenyls.” Environmental Health Perspectives 112 (May 2004): 643–47. http://www.jstor.org/stable/3435987.

Note that for online resources the date of access is not always required.

## Abbreviations
In using periods with abbreviations, the Chicago Manual recommends the following general guidelines in nontechnical settings (http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch10/ch10_sec004.html):
 - Use periods with abbreviations that end in a lowercase letter: p. (page), vol., e.g., i.e., etc., a.k.a., a.m., p.m., Ms., Dr., et al. (et is not an abbreviation; al. is). An exception may be made for the few academic degrees that end in a lowercase letter (e.g., DLitt, DMin); see 10.20 and rule 3.
 - Use periods for initials standing for given names: E. B. White; do not use periods for an entire name replaced by initials: JFK.
 - Use no periods with abbreviations that appear in full capitals, whether two letters or more and even if lowercase letters appear within the abbreviation: VP, CEO, MA, MD, PhD, UK, US, NY, IL (but see rule 4).
 - In publications using traditional state abbreviations, use periods to abbreviate United States and its states and territories: U.S., N.Y., Ill. Note, however, that Chicago recommends using the two-letter postal codes (and therefore US) wherever abbreviations are used; see 10.28. For Canadian provinces and territories, see 10.29. See also 14.286.
 - Note that the British and the French (among others) omit periods from contractions (Dr, assn, Mme). Note also that a slash is occasionally used instead of periods (as in c/o or n/a) but more often denotes per (see 6.107). Units of measure in nontechnical settings are usually spelled out. In scientific usage, periods are generally omitted for abbreviated units of measure and other technical terms: see 10.52–71.
 - Academic degrees: Omit periods (BA, MA, PhD, etc.). Spelled-out terms, often capitalized in institutional settings (and on business cards and other promotional items), should be lowercased in normal prose. Names of degrees, fellowships, and the like are lowercased when referred to generically: a master’s degree; a doctorate; a fellowship; master of business administration (MBA).

## Numbers
Follow the Chicago Manual of Style rules for numbers. The New School Archives follows rule 9.2 that numbers 1-100 are spelled out and numbers after 100 are left as numerals. This is true except at the beginning of sentence, when all numbers should be spelled out (9.4).

## The New School vs. New School

When to use the “The”:
 - Use “New School” in finding aid titles, without the “The”
 - Use “New School” for website titles and creators without the “The”
 - Use the “The” as in “The New School” when referring to that entity in summary note and other descriptive notes within finding aids (but note that the capitalized “The” did not become part of the formal title of the school until the 2000s at some point, so check time period before capitalizing—only capitalize when the dominant period’s usage capitalized it).
 - Use “New School” (without the “The”) when it is a descriptor in a sentence, as in “New School students banded together to protest the Vietnam War . . .”

## References to works in titles or notes
### Published works (including published reports)

The choice of italics or quotation marks for a title of a work cited in text or notes is determined by the type of work. Titles of books, periodicals, films, plays, and major compositions are italicized; titles of articles are enclosed in quotation marks.

### Unpublished works

When author is known, put first, followed by a period, with the title following (whether title is italicized, in quotation or neither differs depending upon rules outlined below. When in doubt, consult the Chicago Manual of Style for further guidance. Do not include the author’s name when the unpublished work is filed hierarchically under the author’s name. 

[Last name, First name]. “[Title]” (Advisor[s]: [Name]), [Date]

Example:    
**Haber, William. "Report Concerning Proposed International Academy Project--New School," 1947 November 8**

Theses, dissertations, reports, book and article manuscripts, unpublished transcripts of speeches, and so on—are capitalized as titles and enclosed in quotation marks. Names of manuscript collections take no quotation marks.

In general, use quotation marks for known titles of articles, essays, reports, speeches, conference proceedings, chapters, and other shorter works.
 - Speech titles: Sometimes headline capitalized, sometimes use quotation marks (see Chicago Manual rules).
 - Conference titles: a substantive title given to a single meeting is italicized and title capitalized; panel discussions, speeches, opening talks are title capitalized and enclosed in quotation marks.

   Example:    
“Making Things Better with XML,” a panel discussion presented at the 
 - AAUP Annual Meeting on June 27, 2008
 - Lecture series and lectures: Names of lecture series are title capitalized. Individual lectures are initial capitalized and usually enclosed in quotation marks.
 - Exhibitions: Titles of large-scale exhibitions and fairs are title capitalized but not italicized. Smaller exhibitions (e.g., at museums) and the titles of exhibition catalogs (often one and the same) are italicized.
 - Operas, oratorios, tone poems, and other long musical compositions: Italicized and standard title capitalization. Titles of songs and other shorter musical compositions are set in roman (i.e., not italicized) and enclosed in quotation marks.

Theses and dissertations [wss added 5/25/16 – up for discussion]
Electronic theses should be described in the same finding aid as paper theses.

Theses and dissertations should be constructed as follows:
[Last name, First name]. “[Title]” (Advisor[s]: [Name]), [Date]

Example:    
**Averbach, Leanne. “Let's Get Lost: Poetry and Myself & Strangeness: A Selection of Critical Essays” (Advisor: David Lehman), 2007**

When no title is evident on the item, supply a title describing the work. In this case, do not use quotation marks or italics.

Example:    
**De Lima, Agnes. Report on adult education, circa 1959**

Note that if the author is The New School, do not include it.
